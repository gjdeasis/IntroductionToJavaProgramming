/*
 * Prompt: (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
 * speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
 * take off using the following formula:
 * length = v^2/2a
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
 * acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway length.
 * 
 * Here is a sample run:
 * Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
 * The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
